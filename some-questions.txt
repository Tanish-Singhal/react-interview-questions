Q1) what does CRA do?
=> it will gives us a dummy application for us. In this the package will give us bundlers, test file for testing, etc.
it will be a ready to go live type of application, in which we just start writing our code.
in this we do not need to worry about the packaging of the content. 

Q2) what is packaging of the content?
=> when we develop a website it has so many files, like css file, component files, etc. and to see the website while developing we have to run that onto a server, it help us to host our website onto a  local server and help to create a build.

Q3) how it create build ?
=> it do with the help of bundlers. CRA has a bundler called webpack and Vite has a bundler name Rollup. It jobs is to quickly compile our code and run it on the local server and by some certain commands we can also build this project.

Q4) what is node modules ?
=> It is a folder which has all the dependecies of our project. While creating a javascript application, it needs help from lots of javascript packages.
